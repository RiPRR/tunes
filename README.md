# tunes
An advanced music recomendation site &amp; service
# why?
In the age of streaming, people have access to more music than ever before. The sheer amount of it can
be daunting at times. Tunes seeks to make it easier for people to discover the music they love. To find the best music possible,
Tunes seeks to use  machine learning techniques such as facial recognition & sentiment analysis combined with more typical
methods such as favorite artists or most played songs (sourced from their favorite streaming app).Tunes also may include sourcing from a users favorite music review sites.
# who?
Anyone who enjoys the discovery of music and is looking for a new fresh way to find good songs. Preferably users of a streaming platform so we can leverage that data.
# how?
A user will link their Streaming account to the service and go through an onboarding. The Onboarding may involve a short quiz, facial/textual sentiment analaysis, and perhaps favorite music review sites. Once done they will be met with a list of albums ans songs that may interest them. They will have the option to re-input their mood/repeat onboarding to change result.
# scope
Tunes is supposed to look good and have a robust backend that sources data from the Spotify API & uses AWS tools to analyze the user. I don't think this project will be an extremly easy task however IF the team is smart about how we build we can do it. I already have done a smaller musicial sentiment analysis app and had a lot of fun with it so I have an idea of where to start.
